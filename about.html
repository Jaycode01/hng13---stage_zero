          I'm a Web Engineer with over 3 years of experience specializing in
          building easy-to-use, conversion-driven interface. I develop web
          solutions for businesses, organization, and companies that turn
          browsers into cutomers. I craft web applications that are as
          technically sound as they are visually compelling. When I'm not
          coding, I workout and watch boxing to clear my head.
